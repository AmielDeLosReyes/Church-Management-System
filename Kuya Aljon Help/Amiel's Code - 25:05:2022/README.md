- Added addToMinistry function
- Proceed button needs to be worked on.
- Need to iterate through the ci_ministry table to print ministry names for choices.
- error on members where $selectedMember is not recognized.
- GOAL: to be able to add a member to a ministry, there is a table created called ci_ministry_mem , I need to figure out how to make a foreign key for
        ci_ministry MINISTRY_ID and ci_ministry_mem MINISTRY_ID
