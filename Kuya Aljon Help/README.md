Problem:
- On Members.php Controller, I'm having trouble making $ministryId be recognized inside the function View($memberId), I tried to add another
parameter View($memberId, $ministryId) but it breaks the app. I also tried to create another function ViewMinistry($ministryId) to solve the 
problem but now it does not recognize the $memberId variable. How would I go about this?
