# Church-Management-System

Welcome to the Church Management System repository! This project aims to revolutionize and automate the manual processes within our church, making tasks more efficient and streamlined.

## Project Overview

Our church currently relies on manual processes for tasks such as membership information, attendance tracking, prayer requests, and more. To enhance these processes, we're transitioning to an automated Church Management System delivered in phases.

### Phase 1: Membership Information and Attendance System

In the initial phase, we've automated the membership information and attendance systems. A web application, accessible only on our local church network, serves as the central hub for storing membership information in a secure database. Each member is assigned a unique Membership Identification Number, accompanied by a QR Code stored as an image. An automated email is sent to members containing their QR Code, which is crucial for the Attendance System.

For the Attendance System, a dedicated computer equipped with a QR Code scanner is stationed at the church entrance. Members present their emailed QR Code upon entry, and the system automatically registers their attendance.

## Future Phases

Our vision for the Church Management System encompasses automating all aspects of church administration, including Financial Reports, Events Organizing, News, Calendar of Activities, and more. This integrated system aims to consolidate various church processes into a single, efficient solution.

## Tech Stack

The Church Management System is developed using the following technologies:

- **PHP CodeIgniter:** Providing a robust framework for web application development.
- **HTML5/CSS3:** Ensuring a modern and responsive user interface.
- **Bootstrap:** Enhancing the overall design and user experience.
- **MariaDB, MySQL:** Serving as the reliable database management systems.
- **AJAX/JSON:** Facilitating seamless data exchange and enhanced user interactions.

Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute to the continuous improvement of our Church Management System. Together, we are creating a more connected and automated church community!
